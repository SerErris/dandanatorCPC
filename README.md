# dandanatorCPC
Thanks to the great work of dandare and the team, a great piece of hardware has been created over the last few years. The Dandanator. This project aims to add to it, document it, helping with troubleshooting and beeing a resource of future collaboration.

*Mario Jiménez “mad3001” for his Z80 code, HW ideas, help with the print run, and for being a vital part of the development team.
*Javier Chocano “Habi” for adapting his personal CPC emulator (In one afternoon!) to support the cartridge, for his help with the VHDL definition and for always responding quickly and well to all the questions we put to him.
*Francisco Javier Velasco “Pagantipaco” for the CPC Dandanator logo in mode 0.
*Javier García Navarro “JGN” and the 4Mhz team for selecting the CPC Dandanator as a platform to distribute their games.
